## Homework_1
First Homework for Fullstack Bootcamp which contains semantic tags after initial review of the html code which did not.
You can find within the build index-copy.html to compare semantics between files.
I apologize for the not unique repository name, went ahead and take the 'descriptive' name of the proyect.

## Motivation
My grade for my first homework, also I took this readme.md from another site.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration . - Still trying to get the hang of the .md format, seems like I need to keep the status images internally?

 
## Screenshots

![code refactor demo](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo)

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Features
Modified the initial semantics on the code.


## Installation

You can just pull the repository and access the index.html

## Current Challenges

Currently there are no challenges as initial requirements have been met.

## Tests
At first when looking at the code seemed overwhelming but easiest way to tackle this was through developer mode and collapse all the sections and hover over the elements, as I was going through each element I took note of what element it was within the site, then switched the 'div' to that particular element.

## How to use?
You can just traverse and navigate through the website.
